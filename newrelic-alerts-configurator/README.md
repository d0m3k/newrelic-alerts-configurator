## Configurator

`Configurator` is the main class used to synchronize all defined configurations with NewRelic. Example use of Configurator:

```java
Configurator configurator = new Configurator(yourApiKey);
configurator.setApplicationConfigurations(yourApplicationConfigurationsCollection);
configurator.setPolicyConfigurations(yourPolicyConfigurationsCollection);
configurator.sync();
```

Both `setApplicationConfigurations` and `setPolicyConfigurations` accept Java Collections of configurations.

## Application configuration

To configure your application in NewRelic you just need to create and pass your application configuration to NewRelic Alerts configurator.
Application configuration can be created using simple builder:

```java
ApplicationConfiguration.builder()
```

What you can set in your configuration:
- application name - Your application name.
- application apdex threshold (optional) - Set apdex threshold for application.
- end user apdex threshold (optional) - Set apdex threshold for end user.
- real user monitoring enabled (optional) - If real user monitoring is enabled. Default value is false.

If application with given application name does not exist exception will be thrown.

Example application configuration:

```java
ApplicationConfiguration configuration = ApplicationConfiguration.builder()
    .applicationName("Application name")
    .appApdexThreshold(0.5f)
    .endUserApdexThreshold(7.0f)
    .enableRealUserMonitoring(true)
    .build();
```

## Policy configuration

To configure your alerts policy in NewRelic you just need to create and pass your policy configuration to NewRelic Alerts configurator.
Policy configuration can be created using simple builder:

```java
PolicyConfiguration.builder()
```

What you can set in your configuration:
- policy name - Name of your alerts policy.
- incident preference - Rollup strategy options for your alerts policy. Possible values are:
    - Per policy
    - Per condition
    - Per condition and target
- conditions (optional) - Collection of [alerts conditions](#alerts-condition) which needs to be configured for your alerts policy.
- external service conditions (optional) - Collection of [alerts external service conditions](#alerts-external-service-condition)
  which needs to be configured for your alerts policy.

  which need to be configured for your alerts policy.
- channels (optional) - Collection of [alerts channels](#notification-channel) which needs to be configured for your alerts policy.

If policy with given policy name exists - it will be updated.

If policy with given policy name does not exist - it will be created.

Example alerts policy configuration:

```java
PolicyConfiguration configuration = PolicyConfiguration.builder()
    .policyName("Policy name")

#### Condition and Channel management policy

All conditions and channels are managed in the same way.

1. If you don't define any conditions in the policy, synchronization process will not modify already existing conditions.
   Example:
   ```java
   PolicyConfiguration configuration = PolicyConfiguration.builder()
       .policyName("Policy name")
       .incidentPreference(PolicyConfiguration.IncidentPreference.PER_POLICY)
       .build()
   ```
   This configuration will not remove, create or update any existing condition.
   
1. If you define some conditions in the policy, then:
    - conditions which are defined in configuration, but are missing will be created.
    - conditions which are defined in configuration and already exist will be updated.
    - conditions which are not defined in configuration, but already exist will be removed.
   Example:
   ```java
   PolicyConfiguration configuration = PolicyConfiguration.builder()
       .policyName("Policy name")
       .incidentPreference(PolicyConfiguration.IncidentPreference.PER_POLICY)
       .condition(condition1)
       .condition(condition2)
       .build()
   ```
   This configuration will create/update condition1 and condition2, and will remove all other conditions.
   
1. If you define empty conditions list in the policy, then synchronization process will remove all existing conditions.
   Example:
   ```java
   PolicyConfiguration configuration = PolicyConfiguration.builder()
       .policyName("Policy name")
       .incidentPreference(PolicyConfiguration.IncidentPreference.PER_POLICY)
       .conditions(Collections.emptyList())
       .build()
   ```
   This configuration will not create nor update any conditions, but will remove all existing ones.
